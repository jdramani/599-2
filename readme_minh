Question 7:
- Extract SWEET ontology into a folder named ontology
- Run SweetConceptExtractor.java to extract the concepts and categories from the ontology files
- Run tika-server with instructions from https://wiki.apache.org/tika/TikaJAXRS.
- Run tika-ner bash script to extract named entity from the data (modify path to data in the script).
- Run extract_sweet_concepts.py to get the intersection betweens these two sets of data.

Question 8:
- Modify path to data in metascorer.py script.
- Run metascorer.py script.

Question 9:
- Locate solr root folder.
- Run bin/solr create -c core_name to create a new index core
- Run bin/solr -c core_name path_to_data_file (data files can be either csv or json files)
- Index csv and json result files from different questions to Solr
	+ For measurement data, use polar as core name
	+ For location data, use polar_geo as core name
	+ For scholar data, use polar_scholar as core name
	+ For sweet data, use polar_sweet as core name
	+ For metadata score, use polar_score as core name
	+ For extra_credit part, use polar_extra as core name
	+ For storing tika-similarity clusters structure, use polar_similarity as core name

Question 11:
- Install tika-similarity as instructed from https://github.com/chrismattmann/tika-similarity/.
- Replace the python files in tika-similarity with our python files.
- Run clustering_script.py to generate the d3 files.
- Run indexer.py to flatten nested structures in d3 json files and index it into solr
